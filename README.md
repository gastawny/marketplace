# :scroll: About

This marketplace project was motivated by a technical challenge proposed by [Orion Aerospace Design](https://orionaerospace.com.br/), an extension project of the Federal Technological University of Paraná ([UTFPR](http://www.utfpr.edu.br/)). The motivation behind this challenge was to create an innovative platform that could efficiently and securely connect buyers and sellers.
